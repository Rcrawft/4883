## 451 - Sort Characters By Frequency
### Ryan Crawford
### Description: 


Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

 

### Example 1




Input: s = "tree"

Output: "eert"

Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.

So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.+ 7 + 0 + 3 = 13.




### Example 2




Input: s = "cccaaa"

Output: "aaaccc"

Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.

Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

### Constraints

    
    1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105
    s consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.
