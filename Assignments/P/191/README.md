## 191 - Number of 1 Bits
### Ryan Crawford
### Description:

Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of
set bitsit has (also known as the Hamming weight).

### Example 1:


Input: n = 11

Output: 3

Explanation:

The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.


### Example 2:

Input: n = 128

Output: 1

Explanation:

The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.


### Example 3:

Input: n = 2147483645

Output: 30

Explanation:

The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.

### Constraints:

    1 <= n <= 231 - 1
